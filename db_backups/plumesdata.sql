Harpist Eveline Gregoire-Rousseau still figures prominently into the arrangements, but the sonic palette of Plumes has burst even further open to include lush instrumentation of whatever sort is necessary for the song, along with greater attention to sound texturing in the production. It was difficult enough to find comparison points for Flotilla ― referencing Radiohead captured the spectacular melodies and complex rhythms, but failed to recognize the band\'s joyous positivity ― but Plumes has achieved such a distinct voice that even simplifying the description to \"classical/indie\" only paints part of a transcendent picture. With an eight-minute, Debussy-inspired, fully-orchestrated centrepiece based upon the Greek myth of Hero and Leander, composer Holbrook and singer/songwriter Charnley are operating near Sufjan Stevens territory, but have also retained a sense of raw rock energy in propulsive tracks like \"Phonebooth\" and created a godly amalgam of Afro-funk and organic soul for \"Away From Home,\" this year\'s grooviest track. Plumes is more easily digestible and less confrontational in its experimentalism than Dirty Projectors\'s Swing Lo Magellan, but is every bit as musically sophisticated and deserving of album of the year consideration.','The ambitious musical partnership has reached sublime new heights on their debut as Plumes.

While some might try and hide their new musical discovery, savouring the music before the masses descend on it, others will share it with everyone they know. Either way, the musical force that you’re hearing that’s on the brink of discovery makes for a thrilling time.\r\n\r\nMontreal’s Plumes who have recently released an eponymous debut album, invokes that kind of buzz. Made up of Geof Holbrook and Veronica Charnley, this musical duo have created an ambitious, textured, and at times epic, ten song, eleven with it’s bonus track, record. With its assortment of strings, various brass arrangements, guitars, and so much more, Plumes is a glorious crossover of classical music grace and indie-pop catchiness.\r\n\r\n“Your Train of Thought Through Tunnels” begins Plumes off in an instant. Charnley’s sweet vocal tone completes the satisfying string filled multi-lingual track. With a melody that gives off a very Regina Spektor feel, “Your Train of Thought Through Tunnels’” poppy love song feel is just one of the many sounds the band is able to successfully convey.\r\n\r\n“Away From Home” and “Figure It Out” both are upbeat and moveable tunes that make for obvious favourites but it’s the use of unconventional instruments, particularly the bass clarinet, which make both songs feel so original and exhilarating.\r\n\r\nContrasting these danceable numbers, Plumes are also creating delicate and incredibly lush songs, most notably highlighted by the “Sweet Georgia Blue.” Ending with Charnley claiming that, “A little Tiffany blue will do,” “Sweet Georgia Blue’s” use of the harp is a wonderful addition, one that is again used to the same degree of effectivity in the album closer, “The Holdup.”\r\n\r\nLike Exclaim Magazine’s review of Plumes mentioned, “Hero and Leander” treads on Sufjan Stevens’ Age of Adz epic territory. An almost eight minute song, “Hero and Leander” lyrically draws from mythology – telling a story, while the instrumentation, like in a Disney movie or wherever you might have been exposed to storytelling meets classical music, expertly matches for such a beautiful composition and you’re left wondering where Plumes have been hiding this whole time.\r\n\r\nThough the album technically ends at “The Holdup,” the indie pop-licious digital bonus track, “Stand Divided” is also worth noting. Leaving their classical music instruments behind them, “Stand Divided” has a similar feel to the earlier song, “Romance at Sala Rossa,” but raises the catchiness appeal for yet another fulfilling song from the band.\r\n\r\nAs you allow the completeness and vitality of Plumes’ record to wash over you, you too will realize you could be listening to the next big band to come out of Montreal.\r\n','This musical duo have created an ambitious, textured, and at times epic record.

The indie rock band released two albums, but while working on the third the music began to change. Instead of making a dramatically different record as Flotilla, Charnley and Holbrook decided to rebrand altogether, and the more classically focused Plumes was born. The band released its self-titled debut last July.\r\n\r\n\"It just turned into another animal. I felt like the forms were different and the songs just seemed to call for something different,\" said Holbrook.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t hard to abandon the name Flotilla, either, after a label man suggested the moniker was better suited to a metal band.\r\n\r\nThough Holbrook has a classical music background, including composing his own work, he kept it mostly separate from his band life. Thanks to Plumes he discovered he could combine his classical and indie sides with great success.\r\n\r\nThere is no such thing as a song-writing degree in Canada, but Charnley - who writes the lyrics and melodies - has the next best thing: A music degree from Concordia and a creative writing degree from McGill.\r\n\r\nSeveral classical players also got involved in Plumes, excited to be involved in something new.\r\n\r\n\"They were sort of pickup people, classical players that I knew and they came in and wanted to be part of it. We hired them for a session and they just stuck around. It just seemed to make sense,\" said Holbrook.\r\n\r\nTo say their music defies categorization is true, but the easiest explanation is that it marries indie with chamber music. Charnley sings with the clear tone and unfussy voice of an indie pop artist. Holbrook has a music education from Columbia University (he\'s taking time off from completing his doctorate there) and knows a thing or two about arranging songs for classical instruments.\r\n\r\nMost of the band is based in Montreal, but Charnley and Holbrook don\'t really have a home base. They\'ve spent time in Paris, New York and Guelph, Ont.\r\n\r\n\"We don\'t really know where we live,\" he said.\r\n\r\nOne of the songs from their debut, Away From Home, speaks to that nomadic lifestyle, each new city is a home away from home and sometimes a home away from home away from home.\r\n\r\nThough that lifestyle isn\'t for everyone, it has its benefits for musicians. Plumes has collaborators in several different cities, including drummers in Paris, New York and Montreal.\r\n\r\nBecause the band plays all kinds of different venues, they often attract very different crowds, from classical veterans to indie rock kids.

But it’s also marked by what you won’t hear on that CD: a lot of electric guitar. And that’s all the more remarkable when you consider that Plumes singer Veronica Charnley writes almost all of her songs on the amplified six-string.\r\n\r\n\r\n“I use recording a lot when I write melodies, so if I find something kind of interesting on the guitar, I’ll record it and then improvise melodies over the top, without playing at the same time,” she explains, reached at a Cochrane, Alberta, tour stop. “And that really frees me up to do some inventive things, although then the trick is to learn to play it and sing at the same time afterwards.”\r\n\r\nUnless, of course, she gives her guitar parts to her husband and bandmate Geof Holbrook to orchestrate, as is often the case.\r\n\r\n“When Veronica writes these songs, the guitar parts sometimes sound like second-guitar parts rather than folk strumming,” he explains, joining Charnley on speakerphone. “They sound like little countermelodies and things. Veronica doesn’t really strum, like an acoustic-guitar kind of thing; it’s like these funny melodies on the electric—and then those little guitar parts might turn into clarinet parts.”\r\n\r\nIt helps that while Charnley takes an intuitive approach to her work, Holbrook is a conservatory-trained composer as well as a highly accomplished bassist and keyboard player. Together, they make a kind of chamber pop that’s leaner and lighter than most similar efforts, with an airy melodic delicacy that’s supported by taut instrumental underpinnings. Louise Campbell’s bass clarinet sometimes handles the bottom end when Holbrook’s on keys; together with Éveline Grégoire-Rousseau’s harp and new member Preston Beebe’s minimal percussion, this makes for a sound that, for once, fully lives up to the description “unique”.\r\n\r\nAs both Holbrook and Charnley note, however, it’s not without precedent. She says, for instance, that while “Away From Home” might have a vestigial connection to the dance floor, it’s rooted in a phrase stolen from new-music icon Steve Reich.\r\n\r\n“I actually took one of his rhythms from Clapping Music and then wrote something over top,” she admits. “So that song is actually quite influenced by classical music—more than my other songs, actually, in terms of the origins of the writing.”\r\n\r\nIn turn, Holbrook says he feels a kinship to Brooklyn’s so-called hipster-classical scene, especially since he and Charnley have spent some time living in New York City. Basically, though, both performers see what they’re doing as more representative of a new paradigm than truly unconventional.\r\n\r\n“We’re seeing this happening in two directions,” Charnley says. “Popular music is expanding into other genres, with classical music being one of them. But also in classical music, that music is expanding, too, to sort of include popular styles. One good example is Bryce Dessner from the National, who has a band called Clogs that has a close connection to what we’re doing.\r\n\r\n“These days,” she adds, “people can hear so much music that there really is room to offer them something new.”\r\n','...[Plumes] make a kind of chamber pop that’s leaner and lighter than most similar efforts, with an airy melodic delicacy that’s supported by taut instrumental underpinnings.

Of course, then, the question is then where does Plumes Ensemble fits in? After all, it’s Plumes Ensemble, not Plumes, that will be coming to Raw Sugar on June 14.\r\nBand members Veronica Charnley and Geof Holbrook tried to explain it to me over the phone.\r\n“There’s no real change of membership,” Geof told me. “It’s basically a name change.”\r\n“Plumes Ensemble is extra members,” Veronica continued, “but there are some permanent members of Plumes Ensemble that seem to be naturally sticking around like Pemi Paull, who plays viola, and Louise Campbell on clarinet.”\r\nYes, you heard right. Not only does Plumes Ensemble feature viola and clarinet  – and honestly, I’m of the opinion that pop music needs more bass clarinet in general – but Thursday’s performance will also feature the band’s harpist, Eveline Gregoire-Rousseau, one of the go-to harpists in Montreal for avant-garde projects.\r\n“The idea of Plumes Ensemble is to be unamplified, for Veronica’s voice,” Geof explained, “so that’s going to be interesting. Like a classical concert. But it’s at Raw Sugar, not the National Arts Centre, so it’s more in the pop scene.”\r\nIf you’re intrigued by the idea of seeing a chamber music version of the band formerly known as Flotilla, you’re not the only one.  Plumes will be releasing their new self-titled LP on July 17, giving the world once more another chance to glimpse into the fantastic magical world of Veronica Charnley and Geof Holbrook. I use “fantastic” in the fantasy-inducing sense of the word.  Songs like “Messy Love” could easily have been part of the soundtrack for those children’s films about magic, like Coraline, full of daydreamy soundscapes with a hint of the eerie, darker things that creep below the surface. The eight minute opus “Hero and Leander”, featuring a 35-piece orchestra, sounds distinctly like something you swear you heard off a classic epic movie soundtrack.\r\nI keep bringing up film soundtracks because that’s the only place where most young people will encounter orchestral arrangements nowadays. But if you were the kind of teenager who secretly adored exploring modern composers like Steve Reich while the other kids were blasting Limp Bizkit in the school halls, you’ll be delighted to be reminded of compositions like Reich’s “Different Trains” in Plumes’ “Your Train of Thought, through Tunnels”.  I’m not sure if these are deliberate conscious similarities – while Plumes member Geof Holbrook is a doctorate student of music composition at Columbia, songwriter Veronica Charnley has no classical schooling.  Despite this, Veronica’s music brings a unique classical twist to pop music.\r\n“It could be that I don’t play guitar in a typical fashion,” Veronica speculates. “I tend to write second guitar parts, but no first rhythm guitar, so you’ve just got two melodies going on instead.”\r\n“Veronica’s songs are kind of abstract,” Geof agreed. “The melodies are inventive and they don’t always sound like pop music. It doesn’t have those pop music licks. And I think that if they did, it would be really hard to play classical harmonization to them. It would kind of sound lame. But because the melodies are the way they are, they remind me of classical composers like Debussy or Bartok.”\r\nThe result is a set of melodies that may not be conventionally catchy in the sense of short, simple, repetitive riffs that you learn easily. Instead, the listener is confronted with unusual melodies that never go where you’d expect them to…and yet they settle disturbingly deep into your subconscious and stay with you long after the last song of the album finishes.  One simply has to wonder, where do these tunes come from? What exactly is goes on in the daydreamy world of Plumes?','Plumes will be releasing their new self-titled LP on July 17, giving the world once more another chance to glimpse into the fantastic magical world of Veronica Charnley and Geof Holbrook.

Plumes has collaborators in several different cities, including drummers in Paris, New York and Montreal.\r\n\r\nThe touring version of Plumes has six people (including viola, electric harp, percussion and clarinet) and, at their show at the Third Avenue United Church, the band will have access to some local musicians provided by the Ritornello Chamber Music Festival. For Holbrook, that’s exciting because it means being able to perform the song Your Train of Thought, Through Tunnels with the instrumentation that appears on the album for the first time.\r\n\r\nThe chamber music show will combine Plumes originals, performed without amplification or drums unlike the album, and the folk songs of composers such as Bartok, Luciano Berio and Arvo Pärt.\r\n\r\nThough the composers’ songs are usually performed with an operatic voice, Charnley will bring her own sound to the repertoire. Holbrook prefers the music sung that way.\r\n\r\n“I might be alone in the classical world on that but I think it sounds much better if you have this pure tone. You can really hear these melodies, which are so great. It’s a different experience than a normal, vocal classical concert. I think we have something to offer there,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe next night, at Vangelis, listeners will get a very different show from Plumes. In the club setting, the band has the opportunity to play its original songs in a totally different format.\r\n\r\nEach song has a couple of different incarnations, depending on the setting and musicians available. Holbrook said it’s fun to be able to experiment.\r\n\r\n“We did it by accident to start with but it’s a really interesting challenge to take a song that’s on the album and has a lot of drums and just to look inside the song and see what else it could be,” Holbrook said. “The way it is on the album is in my head, so much because we worked on it for so long. But redoing it in this new way I find really fascinating; there’s new potential.”\r\n\r\nBecause the band plays all kinds of different venues, they often attract very different crowds, from classical veterans to indie rock kids. Holbrook said fans of Plumes tend to be open-minded music lovers.\r\n\r\nThe Saskatoon shows kick off the band’s first western Canadian tour, but it’s the only city that gets two very different Plumes shows.\r\n\r\n“In Saskatoon, we’re going to do it all.

Half the time, they play as Plumes Ensemble, an expanded classical format of the group that presents their songs in a chamber music setting.\r\n\r\nThink Franz Schubert meets Sufjan Stevens.\r\n\r\nPreviously known as Flotilla, the musical partnership between composer and multi-instrumentalist Geof Holbrook and Veronica Charnley has flourished and branched out in new ways since they adopted their new moniker. Even so, Holbrook says that the group has accepted the limitations of playing as a “classical-indie pop” group.\r\n\r\n“We can’t actually present one side of our sound in one formation,” says Holbrook. “It’s sort of impossible to perform the whole album with one [style of] instrumentation — it just doesn’t work. We either have a drummer and keyboards, or we tour as a chamber group. It’s definitely more of a split live.”\r\n\r\nOn their latest, self-titled album, Plumes weaves together the grace and pomp of string sections with the arrangements of a well-worn indie rock unit. Both highly melodic and versatile, vocalist Veronica Charnley leads the charge by giving an added dimension to what could easily be a satisfying instrumental outing. And for anyone who may be scared off by the classical or chamber-pop tags, don’t be: there’s a refreshing layer of guitar present, along with plenty of lush textures — something the group is attempting to showcase during their live performances.\r\n\r\n“For this tour we’re trying to meld the instrumentation,” says Holbrook. “We have a drummer with us who is also a classical percussionist and a composer, so that’s a good starting point for us to maybe discover how we are going to switch between those two worlds.\r\n\r\n“We’re also playing the same songs in both bands’ sets. If people come to one set and then the other, I think they might recognize the songs they heard before but played in a completely different way.\r\n\r\n“What’s cool about playing Ritornello is that people can see us in both incarnations.”\r\n\r\nThe split personality of the band live isn’t without anxiety, however. On their latest tour in Germany, Plumes was virtually stepping into unknown territory on mixed billing. Holbrook says the band is relieved to have emerged from the experience intact, and is plotting an eventual return to Europe.\r\n\r\n“We had a lot of different people come out, but everywhere we went the audiences were intrigued and attentive,” he says. “A lot of the people there seemed to really gravitate towards us because we were from Canada. At one of our shows we walked in and the band playing was really a trashy, loud rock band. We had no idea what they were going to think of us, but everyone was really into it despite that we were so much more quiet than the first band.”\r\n\r\nGoing forward, Holbrook says that the next step for Plumes is recording a split EP... with themselves.\r\n\r\n“The idea is to separate the Plumes from the Plumes Ensemble,” he explains. “We have a lot of new material, as Veronica was in Paris in the summer on a grant specifically to write new songs.\r\n\r\n“It’s definitely time to record it.”','Think Franz Schubert meets Sufjan Stevens.','http://www.planetsmag.com/story.php?id=1223',0,0),(9,'Winnipeg Free Press','2013-05-23','Kevin Prokosh','Montreal-based Plumes crossing genres on first tour across Western Canada','Plumes is one of those bands that defies categorization, as its classically trained artists make music that is suited for both concert halls and nightclubs.\r\nIts cross-genre cred is on display on its first western Canadian tour, which kicks off in Saskatoon May 24 at the Ritornello Chamber Music Festival with a recital concert featuring classical numbers from Bartok, Luciano Berio and Arvo Part.\r\nThe following night, the Montreal-based ensemble heads to a club, where it will don its indie pop persona, centred around the compelling vocals of Veronica Charnley.\r\nThen Plumes head to The CYRK for their Winnipeg debut with opening act French Press on May 28. Anyone entering the Young Street private arts salon will immediately be curious at the lineup of onstage instruments, which includes Eveline Gregoire-Rousseau\'s harp and Louise Campbell\'s bass clarinet. Charnley\'s husband, bassist/keyboard player Geof Holbrook, promises audience members will even want to watch percussionist Preston Beebe set up his drum kit, which comes in a single suitcase -- the cymbals attach to the suitcase, which also acts as the bass drum.\r\n\"The harp is like the lead guitar,\" says Holbrook over the phone from Montreal. \"That makes our sound more ethereal. You don\'t have screaming solos, although I guess we could try to do that with a distortion pedal.\r\n\"There\'s more freedom with all these strings and serves more possibilities. We don\'t fall into the same patterns, so you get different types of music.\"\r\nThe Ottawa-born Charnley and Holbrook, originally from Guelph, began performing in a band called Flotilla in 2004 and released a debut album, Disaster Poetry, in 2006, followed by One Hundred Words for Water in 2009. The group\'s indie rock was driven by harp player Gregoire-Rousseau, who followed Charnley and Holbrook when they morphed into Plumes.\r\n\"I thought the third album needed stringed quartets and orchestral instrumentals,\" says Holbrooke, a classical composition graduate from Columbia University in New York. \"We had that one piece with orchestra because I couldn\'t imagine doing that song any other way. So we re-branded as a different kind of band. Now it feels really natural. I just wish we had done it before.\"\r\nLast July they released Plumes\' first self-titled album. It earned positive reviews, setting the band up as an act to watch for the musically adventuresome unsatisfied with what they hear on the radio. One critic called their sound \"a glorious crossover of classical music grace and indie-pop catchiness.\"\r\nThe unique sonic palette of Plumes means they have few role models to offer either guidance or direction. One of the few is the unconventional New York-based outfit Clogs, admired for its mix of classical and modern musical elements wrapped up in chamber folk.\r\n\"We are always trying to keep our eye out for groups that do the same thing,\" Holbrook says. \"I really love what Clogs do. They are going for something similar with a bassoon player, and collaborate with a lot of classical musicians.\"\r\nWhile all the musicians are involved in various side-projects -- including Gregoire-Rousseau, who is the substitute harpist for the Montreal Symphony Orchestra -- Charnley is the only member without classical training. She studied creative writing at Montreal\'s Concordia University and pens all the lyrics. Much of the Plumes album features her appealing art songs wrapped in classical instrumental. The two worlds co-exist seamlessly, she says.\r\n\"I don\'t feel there is any tension,\" says Charnley, who counts Bjrk as one of her main influences. \"I feel I have the same taste as Geof, even though I don\'t have the training in contemporary classic music. We tend to always agree on what pieces are good, whether they are pop or classical.\"\r\nIf there is any all-encompassing theme to the Plumes album, it would be the search for intimacy, whether it\'s looking for private space in the big city, as in Phonebooth, or for a paramour, as in Messy Love. The latter is Charnley\'s emotional response to the story of her aunt, who left a bad marriage after many years.\r\nCharnley and Holbrook have been moving around in recent years and are just back from Paris after a stint in NYC. She is not sure where they are based anymore -- a feeling that is reflected in the song Away From Home. Where they will settle next is up for debate.\r\n\"I\'m almost looking at this tour with the possibility that I might want to live in one of these places,\" she says. \"I\'ve never been out west, so it\'s like a real estate tour.\"','The unique sonic palette of Plumes means they have few role models to offer either guidance or direction. One of the few is the unconventional New York-based outfit Clogs, admired for its mix of classical and modern musical elements wrapped up in chamber folk.','http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/music/classic-pop-popular-classic-208618731.html',0,0),(10,'The Leader-Post','2013-05-22','Tonaya Marr','Classical instruments the driving force of Plumes','Though they haven’t faced too many annoying questions yet, there’s one question the Montreal-based band Plumes is tired of people asking them: Where did they get their name?\r\n\r\n“This is only the second interview that we’ve done for this tour,” said Geof Holbrook of Plumes. “So I’m not really tired of any question yet.”\r\n\r\n“I just feel bored when I answer it,” echoed band-mate and wife, Veronica Charnley.\r\n\r\nHolbrook is a classical composition graduate from Columbia University. Charnley, who studied creative writing and poetry at Concordia and McGill universities, is the primary songwriter for the group, and uses creative writing exercises to inspire the wordplay in their music.\r\n\r\nHolbrook and Charney created the indie-pop group Flotilla in 2004, but classical music was calling and Plumes was born as the pair dove into the indie-classical genre.\r\n\r\n“We kind of wanted those classical instruments to be the driving force,” said Holbrook, when asked what concert goers can expect.\r\n\r\nOn May 24, the band takes the stage for the first of a two-night performance at the Ritornello festival in Saskatoon. Not only is the festival offering Plumes the opportunity to demonstrate several facets of their musical abilities, it’s also the event that kick-started their drive to tour Western Canada.\r\n\r\n“We haven’t toured out there yet and it’s our chance to do it,” said Holbrook.\r\n\r\n“I’m excited to see all these cities I haven’t visited, including Regina,” echoed Charnley.\r\n\r\nHolbrook and Charnley make up the constant core of the band, along with harpist and fellow Flotilla-alumni harpist Eveline Gregoire-Rousseau. The band often draws on the musical talent of their friends to bring their music to life, both on stage and when recording their debut album, Plumes.\r\n\r\nThree of the musicians who joined them in the recording studio will also be hitting the road for the western tour: percussionist Preston Beebe, violist Pemi Paull and clarinetist Louise Campbell.\r\n\r\n“I’m really looking forward to playing with these players, because each and every one of them is very good just by themselves,” said Charnley.\r\n\r\nAnd how exactly will all five people fit into a van with all their equipment?\r\n\r\n“A six-man rock band needs a tour bus, but we can fit in a mini can because nobody has a ton of gear,” said Holbrook.\r\n\r\nPlumes perform at Regina’s The Artful Dodger on May 29. Though neither Holbrook or Charnley have previously visited the Queen City, both are looking forward to the experience.\r\n\r\n“(The Artful Dodger) was recommended to us by the Riornello people and they’ve worked with the Artful Dodger before,” said Holbrook. “It seems like a great room and I’m really excited about that show.”\r\n\r\nDuring the Regina performance, violist Pemi Paull will perform a solo set before Plumes take the stage.\r\n\r\n“It’s going to be kind of an unusual concert set up, but I think it’s going to be great,” said Holbrook.\r\n\r\nOh, and where did the name “Plumes” from? It wasn’t discussed, because no one likes to ask annoying questions.',NULL,'http://www.leaderpost.com/entertainment/music/Classical+instruments+driving+force+Plumes/8419783/story.html',0,0),(11,'Rocky Mountain Outlook','2013-05-23','Dave Whitfield',' Montreal classical pop rolls into Wild Flour','If you’ve been waiting for just the right combination of classical music and pop to come along, you’re in luck.\r\n\r\nPlumes, a Montreal five-piece, plays Wild Flour Bakery in Banff, May 31 at 7:30 p.m.\r\n\r\nPlumes, originally founded as Flotilla by Veronica Charnley (vocals, guitar), hubby Geof Holbrook (guitar) and Eveline Gregoire-Rousseau (harp), will be joined by Louise Campbell (clarinet) and Preston Beebe (percussion). Plumes is a hybrid classical/pop blend with indie rock credentials.\r\n\r\nFor Charnley, the band’s western tour from Saskatoon to Victoria offers a chance to reconnect with Banff, where she enjoyed a Banff Centre residency in 2009.\r\n\r\n“I’m really excited about being back there. I had a self-directed songwriting residencey there, with a performance at the end. I wrote a lot of songs and some of the ones we’re playing on this tour were written there (“Kalimba Mountain Song” among them). I found the mountains really inspiring and I mention them in song.”\r\n\r\nThe three began performing as Flotilla in 2004 and released the debut album Disaster Poetry, in 2006. In 2009, the band released One Hundred Words for Water, which became the fourth most played album on Canadian community/campus radio.\r\n\r\nAs Flotilla, the trio performed nationally at festivals and made New York a second home while Holbrook studied at Columbia.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, though, the trio decided to move in a new direction and decided a new name would be in keeping with the change.\r\n\r\n“We were aiming for a crossover between pop and classical,” said Charnley. “In New York, there’s a big movement with it. Eveline plays with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, Geof has a doctorate from Columbia in composition Everyone but me is classically trained.\r\n\r\nCharnley, though, is the songwriter of the group, and the main vocalist. “My songs aren’t really genre-specific,” she said, “they’re just life experiences of mine. Geof does most of the arrangement and players always have room to improvise.\r\n\r\n“Geof and I got together in 2004, about the same time we started doing music, then got married in 2008.”\r\n\r\nThe band’s tour is to support its latest, self-titled, 10-track album. Kicking off with a chamber music festival in Saskatoon, where the band will offer up some Bartok, Luciano Berio and Arvo Pärt. Things will move toward the pop side, though, as Plumes continues westward to the coast playing clubs.\r\n\r\nRecently arriving back in Canada from an eight-month songwriting stint in Paris, “where people are excited to hear you’re in a band from Canada,” Charnley said her stint in the City of Light and in Europe was one to remember and one which will generate more material.\r\n\r\n“We had a few really magical shows there,” she said. “On one university campus we followed a very loud band. We were quite quiet and I was a little worried, but people were right there with us and the promoter came out with Jager shots for everybody. It was a special night in Mainz (Germany).”\r\n\r\nCharnley studied creative writing at Concordia University and said she, “writes outside my comfort zone. My songs are about my life, but it’s not like they’re from my diary.”\r\n\r\n“Messy Love” combines a melody about the unhappy marriage of Charnley’s aunt with some blistering shards of viola courtesy of Pemi Paull, founder of the postmodern chamber ensemble, Warhol Dervish. “The Holdup” is an ethereal love song inspired by witnessing an actual hold-up in New Jersey while “Away From Home” is a catchy number inspired by Charnley and Holbrook’s decade of moves from Montreal to New York to Guelph to Paris… so far.','“Messy Love” combines a melody about the unhappy marriage of Charnley’s aunt with some blistering shards of viola courtesy of Pemi Paull, founder of the postmodern chamber ensemble, Warhol Dervish. “The Holdup” is an ethereal love song inspired by witnessing an actual hold-up in New Jersey while “Away From Home” is a catchy number inspired by Charnley and Holbrook’s decade of moves from Montreal to New York to Guelph to Paris… so far.','http://www.rmoutlook.com/article/20130523/RMO0302/305239981/-1/rmo0302/montreal-classical-pop-rolls-into-wild-flour',0,0),(12,'Vernon Morning Star','2013-05-31','Jennifer Smith','Plumes combines classical sensibility with its ethereal sound','There’s an ethereal quality to Plumes, both its classical ensemble and its indie pop incarnation, to be placed somewhere between Björk and Sarah Slean.\r\n\r\nA quick listen to their summer 2012 self-titled album suggests the flowery boasts of its promoters are finally not musical prowess hyperbole.\r\n\r\nWhile many an indie act might promise the stars, this is one prolific, unmatched creative force grounded in the marriage of singer/songwriter Veronica Charnley, and her composer husband, Geof Holbrook.\r\n\r\nHe has trained in ivy league schools from Columbia University to the Insititut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique in Paris and has been awarded in the SOCAN Competition for Young Composers seven times. She is trained in creative writing and the art of making house wherever their prolific career takes them—often to follow his education.\r\n\r\n“We move a lot so to be able to have Geof give the notations to different musicians in different cities makes everything faster,” said Charnley.\r\n\r\n“Faster” is actually more like light speed for these two who have lived in some of the most prolific creative communities the world over in the last six years and created two, even three, separate bands, if one counts the chamber ensemble and indie pop branches of Plumes as two different acts.\r\n\r\nTheir first group, the very rockesque Flotilla, carved a space for their sound somewhere near Kate Bush and Portishead in the music annals, and met with the kind of acclaim that sees its work lauded totally unique by seasoned music critics.\r\n\r\nWhen the pop sounds of Plumes developed, along with a desire to have a group that could play chamber music spinoffs, it seemed a rebranding was in order.\r\n\r\nCharnley compares the resulting new group to Clogs, an instrumental project from Bryce Dessner of The National, or Shara Worden.\r\n\r\nWhether you’re up on the indie music scene enough to place the examples or not, anyone will be able to appreciate the rare opportunity Plumes offers to hear clarinet and bass clarinet, a reasonably loud instrument, deftly woven into Charnley’s sweet melodies by Louise Campbell, in a popular music group.\r\n\r\nAnd with harpist Eveline Grégoire-Rousseau, a substitute with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, and violinist Pemi Paull joining the band for their Canadian dates, Plumes is a musical force in every sense.\r\n\r\nCharnley and Holbrook met when Charnley’s friend moved to Germany and she assumed her spot as Holbrook’s new roommate. Creating a sense of home is a theme in this work. The pair met Rousseau, who lived in the neighbourhood, within their first month living together and all have been collaborating ever since.\r\n\r\nWhile their music is decidedly experimental, Charnley foresees it becoming even more “harmonically experimental.”\r\n\r\n“I still want to maintain a level of accessibility because I like pretty melodies, but I think the harmonies could be even more out there…with a little bit more dissonance.”\r\n','While many an indie act might promise the stars, this is one prolific, unmatched creative force grounded in the marriage of singer/songwriter Veronica Charnley, and her composer husband, Geof Holbrook.','http://www.vernonmorningstar.com/entertainment/209558331.html',0,0),(13,'Vue Weekly','2013-06-05','Meaghan Baxter','Plumes plays in Edmonton','Indie-pop meets dreamy orchestral chamber music as Plumes melds two ostensibly contrasting worlds.  The group\'s foundation is comprised of vocalist and lyricist Veronica Charnley, classical composer Geof Holbrook (the pair previously performed together as part of Flotilla) and Éveline Grégoire-Rousseau, who also serves as a substitute harpist for the Montréal Symphony Orchestra. The remaining arrangements of Plumes\' intricate compositions are provided by an ever-changing cast of musicians, with regular ensemble members including Pemi Paull (viola), Louise Campbell (clarinet and bass clarinet) and Todd Harrop (timpani and percussion).\r\n\r\n\"The thing with Plumes is it\'s constantly evolving,\" Campbell says during a stop in Saskatoon for the Ritornello Festival, part of Plumes\' first tour of Western Canada. \"I don\'t think everybody could be a part of this band because you need to be able to read, you need to be able play really, really well, you need to be able to serve different styles, you need to be able to improvise a little bit, you need to be able to roll with whatever comes your way, but it\'s fun because it keeps the music evolving.\"\r\n\r\nPlumes\' debut self-titled album was released just over one year ago, but Holbrook notes the ensemble already has plans to get back into the recording studio near the end of the summer—if all goes according to plan.\r\n\r\n\"I\'d really like to make, first of all, a record that\'s just chamber music, just string quartet and various groups of instruments and then do another record that\'s really more of a pop record, but still with classical elements,\" he says, noting in the meantime that there\'s no worry of the group\'s current repertoire becoming monotonous.\r\n\r\n\"Geof\'s constantly tweaking the arrangements, so keeping it interesting is not a problem at all,\" Campbell chuckles.\r\n\r\n\"I should stress that Veronica writes all the songs,\" Holbrook adds. \"She writes the songs and then writes almost a second guitar part; she writes these very thin guitar parts and that\'s the song, and then to arrange it there\'s lots of freedom because she\'s not playing C chord, G chord, F chord ... there\'s a lot of freedom and then choosing the players, there\'s just certain instruments I think fit really well.\"',NULL,'http://vueweekly.com/music/story/plumes/',0,0),(14,'Radio Canada (French TV interview)',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'http://www.radio-canada.ca/widgets/mediaconsole/medianet/6712814',0,0),(15,'Radio Canada (French radio interview)','2013-05-29','host Doris Labrie','L\'Ensemble Plumes poursuit une tournée pancanadienne',NULL,NULL,'http://www.radio-canada.ca/emissions/Jour_de_plaine/2012-2013/chronique.asp?idChronique=295387',0,0),(17,'meinzuhausemeinblog.blogspot.com',NULL,'Gudrun Thäter','Konzert: Plumes & Modern Days (show review in German)','Tonight is an island we can rest on.\r\n\r\nWas für ein intensiver Tag, der mit dem Abend im Haus Mainusch und speziell  im Plumes-Konzert auf wundersame Weise zu sich kam. Eine sehr kurze Nacht, denn nach dem Abend in Mannheim war  ich erst in den frühen Morgenstunden zurück. Früh ins Büro, denn Vormittags stand aushandeln und eintüten von ersten Neuordnungsschritten nach einem materiellen und menschlichen Wirbelsturm in der Arbeitsgruppe auf dem Programm. Am Nachmittag zwei Abschiede am Flughafen mit gespanntem Herzen, inklusive kurzem Familientreffen. Dazwischen sehr konzentriertes Büro halten am Fernbahnhof.\r\n\r\nDer eigentlich unerhebliche Sprung von dort nach Mainz dann mit fast allem was die Informationspolitik auf Bahnhöfen der DB so liebenswert macht. Info beim losgehen zum Fernbahnhof Zug fällt aus - ok. die S-Bahn tut es auch und der S-Bahnhof liegt sowieso näher. Anzeigetafel am S-Bahnhof sagt aber Ersatzzug fährt! Mit einem kleinen Sprint schaffe ich den noch. Japsende knapp rechtzeitige Ankunft am Fernbahnhof - dort die Info Zug etwa 20 min zu spät. Rückweg zum S-Bahnhof (inkl. längerer Fahrtzeit und S-Bahn-Zugtakt) zahlt sich nicht aus. Bei den 20 min bleibt es freilich nicht. Schließlich fährt ein anderer (planmäßiger) Zug ein und was aus unserem Zug wird, ist keine Ansage wert.  \r\n\r\nAm Ende bin ich statt 15 min schlappe 50 min unterwegs nach Mainz. Dass ich darüber fast ruhig bleibe, rechne ich mir als coolness an. Aber, so richtig voller Elan bin ich dann doch nicht mehr und lass mir statt eiligem Fußweg durch die unbekannte Stadt im strömenden Regen dann doch lieber von einem Taxi helfen (Taxi fahren ist für mich normalerweise nur echten Katastrophen vorbehalten). Damit bin ich nur wenige Minuten später als geplant am Haus Mainusch. Nach den vagen Informationen im Vorfeld sollte jetzt eigentlich seit einigen Minuten die Vorband spielen....\r\n\r\nDas Haus Mainusch ist ein selbstverwaltetes Gemeinschaftshaus. Sehr unabhängig und alternativ. Hier wird jede_r respektiert, sogar Raucher... Ich hatte es mir etwas größer vorgestellt - auf der Suche nach der Bühne und bekannten Gesichtern bin ich schnell durch und habe keines von beidem gefunden. Das ist schließlich der Moment, wo sich doch Verzweiflung flüsternd einschleicht.  \r\n\r\nAber ein Gesicht erkenne ich auf einmal doch ... die Plumes Sängerin Veronica Charnley herself ... und an ihrem Tisch gibt es auch noch einen Sitzplatz. Was soll\'s ehe ich groß überlegen kann, stelle mich als Freundin von Oliver Peel vor und sofort entspinnen sich die nettesten Gespräche. \r\n\r\nAm Tisch ist noch eine deutsche Freundin aus gemeinsamen Zeiten in Kanada, die für den Abend auf ein Wiedersehen und -hören gekommen ist. Es geht um Fremdsprachen lernen und verlernen, Tourdönekes, Mutmaßungen über den weiteren Verlauf des Abends. Dann kommt Geof Holbrook (Ehemann und heute verantwortlich an den Tasten) hinzu. Stille Freude als ich erzähle, dass ich das Vorprojekt Flotilla kenne und die CD One Hundred words for water sehr mag (klienicum sei Dank!). Dann gesellt sich ein weiterer Kanadier zu uns, den es zur Zeit nach Deutschland verschlagen hat. Michael Taylor arbeitet am Staatstheater in Mainz als Sänger. Was für ein Energiebündel!\r\n\r\nBevor die Vorband deutlich nach 22 Uhr beginnt, finde ich auch die Bühne in einer Art großer Garage hinter dem Haus. Dort aber leider Ernüchterung: Hier wird (obwohl der Raum als Nichtraucher-Zone ausgewiesen wird) ausgerechnet von der Band selbst geraucht. Erst fängt einer neben mir an,  dann sind im nächsten Moment alle dabei  - die 4-5 unter den 30 anwesenden in den fensterlosen Raum reichen, dass es sehr stört. Ich spreche sie an: ich würde gern über ihren Auftritt schreiben und sei dafür extra aus Karlsruhe gekommen und Rauchen stört mich sehr. Die Reaktion ist Achselzucken (Körpersprache: was bist du denn für eine?) ... und so spare ich mir das Konzert.\r\n\r\nStatt dessen finde ich am Tisch im Haus den Plumes Drummer  Todd Harrop und wir haben ein interessantes Gespräch über ein harmonisches System an dem er gerade arbeitet und für das er nach einem guten Modell sucht, das über das geordnete aufschreiben von Zahlen hinausgeht. Wir haben Spaß, den Zusammenhang von Mathematik und Musik zusammen zu ergründen und die Faszination an dem Gedankenspiel zu teilen, das bei ihm zu komponierter Musik und Experimenten damit führen wird.\r\n\r\nSchließlich wird es nach 23 Uhr ernst. Die Plumes-Musiker machen die letzten Handgriffe, um Mikros, Gitarre und Keyboard an den Verstärker zu bringen und ein improvisiertes Drumset zu sortieren.\r\n\r\nVeronica begrüßt das Publikum sehr herzlich und mit den ersten melodischen Phrasen - noch ohne Unterstützung der zwei Herren - hat sie sozusagen im Handstreich das Publikum: Der erste Applaus ist euphorisch. Beim zweiten Song (das erste Stück des aktuellen Albums mit englischen und französischen Textteilen - sehr faszinierend!) ist die Bude wieder ordentlich voll. Er hat alles, was die Musik von Plumes so faszinierend und interessant für mich macht: die Stimme von Veronica, die anscheinend schwerelos über die komplexen Melodiephrasen und Rhythmen schwebt und doch ganz festgezurrt im hier und jetzt ist. Es folgen danach mehrere ruhigere Songs mit sehr dezenter Schlagzeugunterstützung. Vor Kalimba mountain song erzählt sie uns, dass es kein Spaß ist, im eiskalten Winter von Montreal eingemummelt Treppen zu steigen. So wird das slow motion im Text fast körperlich erfahrbar. Bei Messy love gibt es spontane Lacher über die Textstelle, dass sie sich lieber auf Kiefernnadeln betten würde.\r\n\r\nDas letzte Lied Away from home geht schließlich wirklich direkt ins Ohr und ist zugleich Ohrwurm und unbedingte Mitwippnummer trotz der vertrackten Taktwechsel und ungeraden Taktlängen. Ein rechter Rausschmeißer eigentlich. \r\n\r\n\r\nFreilich lässt sich das begeisterte Publikum nicht ohne Zugabe wegschicken. Auch hier gibt es eine Geschichte zum Lied. Unversehens war Veronica in die Situation geraten, dass nur Armlängen entfernt ein Polizist jemanden mit Pistole am Kopf befahl, die Hände hoch zu nehmen. Bei ihr wird aus der emotionalen Erschütterung ein Liebeslied. Eine rechte Hymne, die mich beschwingt in die Nacht gehen lässt. Der Fußweg ins Hotel ist mir danach egal, obwohl es immer noch dolle regnet.\r\n\r\nMuss dann auch gar nicht sein. Nach kurzem ersten Wegstück kommt eine Busstation in mein Blickfeld - voller Konzertbesucher, die ich um Rat fragen kann und schon 2min später fährt mich ein für die Uhrzeit ziemlich voller Bus bis fast vor mein Hotel. \r\n\r\nEin Abend mit mir bis dahin fremden Menschen so voller Freundlichkeit und anregender Gespräche und Impulse. Und die Musik so zauberhaft und dabei doch auch so irdisch. Ein wahrhaft würdiges Finale für meine drei Musik-abenteuerlichen Tage. Und ins Staatstheater muss ich schnellstmöglich auch...\r\n\r\n(Die Überschrift ist aus Away from home by Plumes)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSetlist Plumes:\r\n(1) Behold it\r\n(2) Your train of thought, through tunnels\r\n(3) Phonebooth\r\n(4) Kalimba mountain song\r\n(5) Messy love\r\n(6) Woodstock\r\n(7) Figure it out\r\n(8) Sweet Georgia blue\r\n(9) Beached dolphin\r\n(10) Comfort in future loves\r\n(11) Away from home\r\n\r\n(Z) The Holdup \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSetlist Modern Days:\r\n(1) Modern days\r\n(2) Your ghost\r\n(3) Too well\r\n(4) Navigator\r\n(5) Rosemary\r\n(6) Metropolitain\r\n(7) House of Leaves\r\n(8) Beat the devil\r\n(9) Weatherman\r\n',NULL,'http://meinzuhausemeinblog.blogspot.ca/2013/04/plumes-mainz-260413.html',0,0);
