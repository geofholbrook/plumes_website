Plumes is a hybrid pop/classical group originating from Montréal, whose recent "homes away from homes" have included New York City and Paris. Singer/guitarist and songwriter Veronica Charnley, former frontperson for Canadian indie rock group Flotilla, is joined by musicians from diverse backgrounds, including composer and multi-instrumentalist Geof Holbrook, harpist Éveline Grégoire-Rousseau, drummer Karl Jannuska and an expanding cast of orchestral players.

On the group's eponymous full-length, released in July 2012, Charnley's inventive songwriting is supported by arrangements for string quartets, brass quintets, clarinets and violas, and even a full orchestra in a central eight-minute track inspired by the Greek myth of Hero and Leander. The record received glowing reviews from publications such as Exclaim! and NYC Deli Magazine, and it's been broadcast extensively on CBC Radio.

The band has toured across Canada, Germany, France and the U.S. They've appeared in festivals such as Wolfe Island Festival, Evolve, Ritornello Chamber Music Festival, NXNE, Brain Cave, and Hans Dampf Festival. 

They are currently mixing two albums, an indie-pop album that was recorded at Castle Rohrsdorf, near Dresden, Germany, in February 2014. The other, for chamber orchestra and voice, was recorded in Montréal at Mechanicland Studios in January 2014 and will be released under the name Plumes Ensemble. They're excited to share these two sides of themselves in concerts across Europe and North America in the coming year.
