Plumes is a hybrid pop/classical group originating from Montréal, whose recent "homes away from homes" have included New York City and Paris. Singer/guitarist and songwriter Veronica Charnley, former frontperson for Canadian indie rock group Flotilla, is joined by musicians from diverse backgrounds, including composer and multi-instrumentalist Geof Holbrook, harpist Éveline Grégoire-Rousseau, drummer Noel Webb (Skydiggers) and an expanding cast of orchestral players.

On the group's eponymous full-length, released in July 2012, Charnley’s inventive songwriting is supported by arrangements for string quartets, brass quintets, clarinets and violas, and even a full orchestra in a central eight-minute track inspired by the Greek myth of Hero and Leander. The record received glowing reviews from publications such as Exclaim! and Deli Magazine, and it been broadcast extensively on CBC Radio.

The band has toured across Canada, Germany, and played in Paris and NYC. They’ve appeared in festivals such as NXNE, Wolfe Island Festival, Evolve, Ritornello Chamber Music Festival, Brain Cave, and Hans Dampf Festival. They are currently preparing to head back into the studio to record their sophomore album.
